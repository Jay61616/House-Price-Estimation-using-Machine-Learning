# 🏡 House Price Prediction with Random Forest

This project predicts house prices using a Random Forest regression model and visualizes key insights using Python libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Estimate house prices based on building features
- Visualize relationships between features and price
- Evaluate the model using R² and Mean Squared Error

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Attributes: Elevator, Address, Warehouse, Parking, Rooms, Area, and Price (USD)

---

## 🔍 Analysis & Visuals
- **Distribution of Prices**: Bar graph
- **Actual vs Predicted Prices**: Scatter plot
- **Price by Elevator Availability**: Box plot

---

## 🧠 Results
- **R-squared**: 0.9596
- **Mean Squared Error**: 2,945,622,608.81

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)
- ipywidgets (interactive UI)
- RandomForestRegressor
