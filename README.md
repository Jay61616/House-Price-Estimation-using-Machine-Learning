This model estimates the price of a house by the parameters given by the user.
Used a dataset that has almost 3,400 records of houses with their parameters including Area, room, parking, warehouse, elevator, address, and Price.
Trained the model using random forest by specifying Price as dependent and remaining parameters as independent.
Plotted graphs for distribution of price, predicted vs actual prices, and price distribution based on presence of elevator.
Define widgets for the user interface.
