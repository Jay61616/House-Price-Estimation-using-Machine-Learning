Final Project Submission: Result and actual Steps

Please specify the objectives of your project:

Please list the tools that were used in your project:

Please state the results achieved by your project:

Please list at least 5 published papers in the same area (your own final project area). The papers must be published in a peer reviewed journal and/or conferences. For each paper give its main feature, drawback and strength.

From the above published papers, select the best one depending on your review.

It is difficult to select a single best paper from this list, as each paper has its own strengths and weaknesses and focuses on different aspects of house price prediction. However, if we consider the main features, strengths, and drawbacks of each paper, we can identify the paper that provides the most comprehensive and novel approach to house price prediction.

Based on this criterion, paper #3 by Chen, Liu, and Hu (2021) stands out as the best option. This paper proposes a hybrid model for house price prediction that combines machine learning and statistical methods, including random forest, gradient boosting, principal component analysis, and correlation analysis. The study is conducted on a dataset of house sales in Shanghai and provides a novel approach that can improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.

Please list the main tasks of your project, the steps within each task that you have already taken to achieve your results. Please try to add a screenshot of each step. For example, your steps might look like:

Task 1: Download the data from Kaggle.

Task2: Processing the data, removing unwanted and invalid data from dataset.

Task3:  Writing the python code, firstly importing the libraries.

Task4: importing dataset to the code using python.

Task5: Dividing data into 2 parts Dependent and independent (X and Y).

Task6: Extract unique addresses from the 'Address' column.

Task7: Preprocess categorical features

Task8: Train random forest regression model

Task9: Calculate mean squared error and R-squared of model.

Task10: Plotting the graphs.

Task11: Predict price using trained model.

Task12: Creating user interface.

Compare your results with the result achieved results by the best solution of step 5.
